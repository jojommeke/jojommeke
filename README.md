~~making dynamic wordpress sites (fully custom themes) for people who need them ;)~~ <br />

still searching for wp alternative that works with/uses react and tailwind <br />

haven't used windows in the past 3 years(i think) <br />
used kde, now uses gnome because it's more polished and less settings to spent too much hours configuring <br />
distro doesn't matter, i use kernel 6.9 (no it's not a joke) <br />

web developer<br />
| ~~css~~ tailwind ofc | html/Jsx/tsx | ~~php~~ fuck php, react is better | nextjs |<br />
