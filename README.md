~~making dynamic wordpress sites (fully custom themes) for people who need them ;)~~

still searching for wp alternative that works with/uses react and tailwind

haven't used windows in the past 3 years(i think)
used kde, now uses gnome because it's more polished and less settings to spent too much hours configuring
distro doesn't matter, i use kernel 6.9 (no it's not a joke)

| ~~css~~ tailwind ofc | html | ~~php~~ fuck php, react is better |<br />
